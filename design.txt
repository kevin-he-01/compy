Required explicit binding:

Like:

Immutable variable
val(<name> = <expr>)
Mutable variable
var(<name> = <expr>)
Debatable: Mutable variable that can be accessed in nested functions/closures, like x in :
>>> def heap():
...     x = 0
...     def inc():
...             nonlocal x
...             x += 1
...     def get():
...             return x
...     return (inc, get)

var_closure(<name> = <expr>)

Need syntactic sugar to implement with transform done before ANF phase, since x may turn into $heapvar.x, not immediate

Static nested scoping like:

https://peps.python.org/pep-0227/

Use `with` liberally to start new scopes not supported in the Python language

# Infinite loop (rust: loop {}):

with loop:
    ...

# declare new scope:

with _:
    ...
